#@ maya, you might need to look at these two:
  # test "Order status will only be valid if they are any of the following: completed, canceled, ____,____ ." do
  #   order = create(:order, status: "something wonky")
  #
  #   assert order.valid?
  # end

  # test "Order status will not be valid if its not any of the following: ___, ___, ___" do
  #   order = create(:order, status: "something wonky")
  #
  #   assert order.invalid?
  # end

# *email* will we make this necessary?
# also might be able to add this to a hash in factory so you can be certain to test all cases.
# additionally you can test the postive case of things.
