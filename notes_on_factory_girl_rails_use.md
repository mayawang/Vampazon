# factory_girl_rails
Documentation: https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails

+ factory_girl is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax
+ support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects)
+ support for multiple factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.

Note_to_self: Currently using: Rails 4.2.6

##REASONS TO USE 'factory_girl':
1. https://www.hiringthing.com/2012/08/17/rails-testing-factory-girl.html
+ Good explanation of why its helpful: "The first (and possibly best) reason to use Factory Girl is because it solves the single worst problem of fixtures: maintenance. Tests become much easier to maintain when you can request a model instance that is always current."
+ Thorough examples!

better than fixtures.
+ "How Factory Girl helps avoid mystery guests: Let's look at a specific example. Fixtures often lead to Mystery Guests, an anti-pattern where we are performing some assertions in our tests but it's not at all obvious at a glance what the data we're asserting against.
3. http://culttt.com/2016/02/17/replacing-fixtures-with-factory-girl-in-ruby-on-rails/
+ Gives great examples and discusses why "replacing fixtures with factories is helpful."
+ "Firstly, instead of defining each Fixture, you define a Factory that can be used to create models of that type. The Factory is basically just a blueprint for creating instances of that model object. Now whenever you need an instance of the model, or you need to pre-populate the database with data for a given scenario, you can use the Factory. is means that only the data required for the test will be in the database and itâ€™s immediately clear where that data came from.

+ Article goes over how to write and understand has_many associations.
+ Ex Factory:
```
factory :article do
  body 'password'

  factory :article_with_comment do
    after(:create) do |article|
      create(:comment, article: article)
    end
  end
end

factory :comment do
  body 'Great article!'
end
```
+ Nice. Callbacks let us do this:
```
article = create(:article_with_comment)
```
+ Article also covers: Polymorphic relationships

## Notes on Minitest, found most examples of using 'factory_girl_rails' used Rspec. Found these helpful for using Minitest syntax.
